Hashtags are used to mark keywords or topics in a Tweet. They are included by users organically to categorize Tweets and help them show more easily in Twitter Search. The symbol of hashtag is “#”, users can add this symbol before a relevant keyword or phrase anywhere in the Tweet, but the phrase or keyword should not contain spaces.

This function is actually called a Twitter Card. Websites have to include <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"> to the HEAD section of the HTML in order to use Twitter Card. When the tweet contains a link to an article on a website that included the aforementioned HTML code in the HEAD section, there will be a “View summary” button on the tweet instead of Expand. The summary will provide the preview of the article for the users. If the user click anywhere on the preview, the user will be navigated to the source of the article.

After inputting a correct password, click the blue "Save Changes" button to confirm the change. If user does not want to make any change on language setting, he/she can click the grey "Cancel" button. This will bring the user back to the Account settings page with all original settings.
